This repository was for Atlassian's first independent hackathon, 2024.

The task was to build a macro for Atlassian confluence pages, using Forgehack and Forge UI, with the aim of supporting Atlassian employees to use their paid volunteering days.

I worked in a team of 3, comprising of Arousha Soltany, Parth Aggarwal, and myself (Alydiira Price).

We built a macro that can be shared across a team at Atlassian and implemented in any page. It is a volunteering hours tracker where the manager sets a goal for their team, and as each team member logs their contribution the macro image changes. The image starts as a seed and grows into a tree the closer the team gets to their shared goal. We aimed at fostering community through positive reinforcement and friendly competition. 
We successfully built the front end, but ultimately failed to finish the backend in the 72 hours.
Our aim for the backend was to integrate a database, potentially with a MongoDB API, to store the accounts of each member in a team so we could retain the updated goal points and members at each page refresh. We had difficulty integrating external databases into the confluence page macro.
In future, we would work on building our own database as we believe security permissions were the main hinderance to the MongoDB database, or work on an app without a database in the short 72 hour timeframe.

We ultimately made it to finals and placed 2nd.
